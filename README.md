# Mom-s-Pebble-App

Javascript file to be loaded and run on my mom's pebble watch. She suffers from a rare medical condition and needs emergency help at times, with the press of a button a message is sent and me and my father are alerted. Uses open source JS email library to send texts for messaging.
